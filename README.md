# Servermgm
Server room management system; I wanted a quick system that I could access on any LAN computer to see what disks/server/... we have around.
We used excel sheets before, but thats just bad practice, so I took the time to throw some software together add some sql and voila,
here you see our first attempt at a inventory system.

# Install
You can use it, but beware that update paths might not be available in the future.

1) insert into new database : setup.sql<br />
2) copy & modify :  /application/config.php.default -> /application/config.php<br />
3) copy & modify :  /application/database.php.default -> /application/database.php<br />
4) copy & modify :  /application/routes.php.default -> /application/routes.php<br />
5) browse to the location<br />
